        pudding, from that anguish they came but they were not kind creatures but
        ones of terror seeking not to satiate the students but instead to feast upon
        them. Beware, for once you hear the crinkling of crisp packets and the rattling
        of change it is to late!\u200B\r\n\r\nAdvice: Despite their large frame of
        size they show incredible swiftness once prey is near, capable of being upon
        victims in a matter of seconds. It is also known they will primarily take
        the form of vending machines, while they won't be every machine they very
        well could be...\u200B"
